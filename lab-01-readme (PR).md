# Lab 01 â€“ IAM Users, Groups, and Roles with EC2 Role Access

## Description
This lab demonstrates identity management in AWS using the IAM console and EC2. It simulates real-world user provisioning and role-based access control, following best practices for cloud security.

## Objective
Build foundational IAM skills by creating a secure access structure using IAM users, groups, policies, and roles. Then validate role-based access by launching an EC2 instance with read-only access to Amazon S3.

---

## Tools Used
- AWS Console
- EC2 Instance Connect
- AWS IAM
- Amazon S3
- AWS CLI

---

## Key Tasks Completed

### 1. IAM User Creation
- Created a new IAM user: `john.doe`
- Granted programmatic and console access
- Assigned user to a new IAM group: `Developers`

### 2. IAM Group & Policy
- Created an IAM group: `Developers`
- Attached **AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess** policy
- This ensures the user inherits read-only access to S3 through the group

### 3. IAM Role for EC2
- Created a role named `EC2_S3_ReadOnlyRole`
- Selected **EC2** as the trusted service
- Attached **AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess** to the role
- Purpose: Allow EC2 instances to access S3 securely without long-term credentials

### 4. EC2 Launch and Role Assignment
- Launched an Amazon Linux 2 EC2 instance (`t2.micro`)
- Attached the `EC2_S3_ReadOnlyRole` IAM role at launch
- Connected to the instance via **EC2 Instance Connect**

### 5. Test IAM Role via CLI
- Ran: `aws s3 ls`
- Successfully listed accessible S3 buckets
- Confirmed IAM role permissions were applied correctly to the EC2 instance

### 6. S3 Bucket Creation
- Created test bucket: `iam-lab-test-bucket-cj2025`
- Verified its visibility from EC2 instance using AWS CLI

## What I Learned

- How to securely manage users and groups using IAM
- The difference between **user-based** and **role-based** access
- How to create and attach **managed policies**
- How to assign **IAM roles to EC2 instances**
- How to test access securely using **AWS CLI**
- Importance of **least privilege** and separation of duties in IAM
- Basic use of **EC2 Instance Connect** for testing cloud services
- Confirmed how role-based credentials work without needing access keys

## ðŸ§  Personal Reflection

As someone pivoting into tech from a leadership background at T-Mobile and a former D1 basketball player, this lab made IAM concepts click in a way that felt familiar.

Creating IAM users felt like setting up individual players on a team â€” each with a defined identity. Adding those users to groups reminded me of assigning positions: guards, forwards, centers. Just like in basketball, where each position has its role, IAM groups help enforce clear responsibilities.

Writing and attaching policies was like designing a playbook â€” some players can shoot, others set screens, and everyone has boundaries. The IAM role I created for EC2 was like a 6th man â€” a temporary player that gets called into the game with a very specific job, without needing full access to everything.

Using the EC2 instance to list S3 buckets proved that the role and permissions were working â€” like checking if a player's badge actually opens the locker room.

This lab didnâ€™t just teach me how to click through the AWS Console â€” it showed me how identity, security, and automation all connect in the cloud. Thatâ€™s what IAM is really about: putting the right players in the right position, at the right time, to protect the team and win securely.
